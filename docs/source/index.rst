Welcome to the MATLAB HEDTools documentation! This package provides comprehensive tools for working with **Hierarchical Event Descriptors (HED)** - a standardized framework for annotating events and experimental metadata in neuroscience and beyond.

What is HED?
------------

HED is a standardized vocabulary and annotation framework designed to systematically describe events in experimental data, particularly neuroimaging and behavioral data. It's integrated into major neuroimaging standards:

* `BIDS <https://bids.neuroimaging.io/>`_ (Brain Imaging Data Structure)
* `NWB <https://www.nwb.org/>`_ (Neurodata Without Borders)

Key features
------------

* **Validation**: Verify HED annotations against official schemas
* **Analysis**: Search, filter, and summarize HED-annotated data
* **BIDS integration**: Full support for BIDS dataset validation and processing
* **Web services**: Access HED online tools and validators via web services
* **Multiple formats**: Work with JSON sidecars, TSV files, Excel spreadsheets, and MATLAB structures
